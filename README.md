Whether you're reading this because you were in YGLF 2019 and got our Eko bag, or you're just a stock photos enthusiast - you've come to the right place!

## What's this about?

So our CTO gave us the job of making a sort of recruitment flyer for YGLF, so we took some images of the office and the team. And everyone is having fun. And then we thought maybe someone else will want to use them for their recruiting! I mean it doesn't make a lot of sense but who are we to judge. 
So in the spirit of open source we're sharing our stock photos with you.

Also - since we mentioned it - [Yes, We are recruiting](https://goeko.co/2HTsfyU).
