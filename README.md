Whether you're here because you're reading Twitter instead of working, you were in [YGLF 2019](https://www.israel.yglfconf.com) and got our Eko bag, or it's just that you're a stock photos enthusiast - you've come to the right place!

![Stock Photos of Eko Engineering Employees](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3951311/59327676-edbbe880-8cf2-11e9-98bf-9b2e8fe3edfb.png)


## What's this about?

So our CTO gave us the job of making a sort of recruitment flyer for YGLF, so we took some images of the office and the team. And everyone is having fun. And then we thought maybe someone else will want to use them for their recruiting! I mean it doesn't make a lot of sense but who are we to judge. 
So in the spirit of open source we're sharing our stock photos with you.

Also - since we mentioned it - [Yes, We are recruiting](https://goeko.co/2HTsfyU).
